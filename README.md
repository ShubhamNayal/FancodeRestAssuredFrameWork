# API Automation Framework

This is a REST API automation framework built using Java, TestNG, RestAssured, and Allure.

## Overview

This framework is designed to automate REST API testing using Java-based tools and libraries. It provides a structured approach to writing and executing API tests, generating comprehensive test reports, and maintaining test data and configurations.

## Features

- **Modular Structure:** Organized into separate packages for API clients, configuration, enums, helpers, and test cases, providing a clear separation of concerns and easy navigation.
- **TestNG Integration:** Utilizes TestNG for test case management, allowing the execution of tests, grouping, parallel execution, and test configuration through annotations.
- **RestAssured Integration:** Uses RestAssured for making HTTP requests, validating responses, and extracting data from JSON/XML responses.
- **Allure Reporting:** Integrates Allure for generating interactive and comprehensive test reports with detailed information about test execution, including step-by-step descriptions, attachments, and historical trends.
- **Configuration Management:** Supports configuration management through properties files, allowing flexible configuration of test environments, endpoints, and other settings.
## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Java JDK, Maven, Allure and TestNG installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. **Import Project:** Import the project into your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
4. **Configure Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary dependencies are configured in the `pom.xml` file.
5. **Run Tests:** Execute test cases using TestNG, or your IDE's test runner.
6. **View Reports:** After test execution, view Allure reports in the make sure you have allure in your machine and uses command `allure serve allure-results`.

## Usage

1. **Writing Tests:** Create new test cases in the `tests` package using TestNG annotations and RestAssured API.
2. **Executing Tests:** Run tests using TestNG, or your IDE's test runner.
3. **Analyzing Reports:** View detailed test reports generated by Allure in the `allure serve allure-results` directory.
